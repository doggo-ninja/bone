# Bone

A desktop client for doggo.ninja. Currently only built for macOS but theoretically works cross-platform.

**[Download the latest release!](https://github.com/kognise/bone/releases/latest)**

I don't have the budget to pay Apple to sign and notarize the app, so it might display a warning saying it can't be checked for viruses. Just open System Preferences, navigate to Security & Privacy, and click Open.

## FAQ

**It's asking for a token, where can I get one?**

Right now doggo.ninja is an invite-only file host, due to the fact that while it's fast there are almost no restrictions. If you have any programming know-how, try to solve the challenge on [the website](https://doggo.ninja/), otherwise [dm me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kognise) and I might be able to help you out!

**X is broken!!!**

That's not a question... Anyways, Bone is really buggy because I literally just made it. Feel free to report the bug on the Issues tab, I'll probably fix it as fast as I can.

**How do I know when an update is available?**

The Electron auto-update client is broken for unsigned macOS apps, until I finish writing my own client there's basically nothing you can do. Sorry about that.

**What does it look like?**

Here's a :poop:y gif I made:
