# Bone

A desktop client for doggo.ninja. Currently only built for macOS but theoretically works cross-platform.

## FAQ

**It's asking for a token, where can I get one?**

Right now doggo.ninja is an invite-only file host, due to the fact that while it's fast there are almost no restrictions. If you have any programming know-how, try to solve the challenge on [the website](https://doggo.ninja/), otherwise [dm me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kognise7) and I might be able to help you out!

**X is broken!!!**

Feel free to report a bug on the Issues tab in GitHub and I'll probably fix it as fast as I can!

**How do I know when an update is available?**

This will now automatically notify you if an update is available and download it for you.

**What does it look like?**

Here's a gif I made many versions of macOS ago:
